Elements of Computer Systems

    Application Software
    Operating System
    Instruction Processor: x86, ARM, GPU, Accelerator
    Hardware Technology: Logic gates, transistors

BILLIONS of transistors in a 1.25cm by 1.25cm square.

Interfaces = abstraction and set of operations

ISA: Instruction Set Architecture
ISA's form the notion os processor families: 386--486--Pentium--PII--PIII--PIV, PowerPC--G4, 68000--68020--68040, IBM 360, ARMv5---ARMv6--ARMv7

Central issue in computer architecture is he design of interfaces to manage complexity while delivering performance.

Brief intro to boolean logic and circuits for system designs
-Boolean Algebra
-Complete logic functions
-DeMorgan's law/mathmatical properties


Fan-in: # of inputs for a logic gate
Fan-out: # of outputs for a logic gate
