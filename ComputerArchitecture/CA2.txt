How do we decide what's a good computer architecture?
    - Design drives implementation which drives design.
    - Response Time: how long it takes to do a task.
    - Throughput: total work done per time unit.
    - Relative Performance: Performance = 1/Execution time

    Measuring exectuotuion time: 
        - Elapsed Time = total response time (processing, I/O, idle time,
	  determines system performance. 
	- CPU Time = time spent processing a given job (discounts I/O, other
	  jobs' shares)
	
CPU Clocks
    - Operation of digital hardware governed by a constant-rate clock
    - Clock period: duration of a clock cycle, ie. 500ps
    - Clock frequency: cycles per second, ie. 2.0 GHz = 2000MHz

    Example
    
    Computer A: 2GHz clock, 10s CPU Time
    Computer B: Aim for 6s CPU time, can do faster clock, but causes 
    1.2xclock cycles

Instruction Count:
    - For a program, determined by program, ISA and compiler
    - Average cycles per instruction determined by CPU hardware
    - Different instructions can have different CPI

    - Stored Program
    - Basic operations
    - Flexible execution of operands
    - Conditional execution
