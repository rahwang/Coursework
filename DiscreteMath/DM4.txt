Close formed expression:

How many binary strings of length n are there? 2^n

Product rule: if a "procedure" P can be broken into m independent sub-tasks T1
 ... TM st Ti can be performed in ni ways then P has n1(n2)...nm solutions.

Proof #1 Induction
A(n) - "[n] has precisely 2^n subsets"

Induction base: A(1)
Induction step: A(n) => A(n+1)
