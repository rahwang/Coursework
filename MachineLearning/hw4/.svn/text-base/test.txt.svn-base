there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it  a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and the talking over its head very uncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice only as its asleep i suppose it doesnt mind

the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it  no room no room they cried out when they saw alice coming theres plenty of room said alice indignantly and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table

have some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone

alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea i dont see any wine she remarked

there isnt any said the march hare

then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said alice angrily

it wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the march hare

i didnt know it was your table said alice its laid for a great many more than three

your hair wants cutting said the hatter he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech

you should learn not to make personal remarks alice said with some severity its very rude

the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a raven like a writing desk

come we shall have some fun now thought alice im glad theyve begun asking riddles  i believe i can guess that she added aloud

do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the march hare

exactly so said alice

then you should say what you mean the march hare went on

i do alice hastily replied at least  at least i mean what i say  thats the same thing you know

not the same thing a bit said the hatter you might just as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see

you might just as well say added the march hare that i like what i get is the same thing as i get what i like

you might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe

it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing desks which wasnt much

the hatter was the first to break the silence what day of the month is it he said turning to alice  he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear

alice considered a little and then said the fourth

two days wrong sighed the hatter i told you butter wouldnt suit the works he added looking angrily at the march hare

it was the best butter the march hare meekly replied
